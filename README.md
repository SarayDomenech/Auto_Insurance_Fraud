<h2 align="center"><b>Insurance Claims 2015</b></h2>


This project addresses the issue of fraud detection in auto insurance claims using data science and machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify the profile of users committing fraud, the key characteristics of fraudulent claims, and develop a tool to calculate the probability of fraud in new claims.


The dataset used in this study is called "insurance_claims.csv" and is available on the Kaggle platform under the *Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license*.

The dataset consists of various features that provide information about the reported incident as well as the customer submitting the claim. The target variable is the fraud report, provided by insurance professionals.


Each row in the dataset represents an auto insurance claim filed between January and March 2015.
